    </header>
    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Initially, I published <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/jherek-healy/applied-quantitative-finance-for-equity-derivatives-second-edition/hardcover/product-n688ye.html">my book</a> through the simplest solution, Amazon CreateSpace, now known as Amazon KDP. The experience was overall great. Amazon KDP allows to print the book in the size of our choice. The standard paper quality is good and the cover looks very much like the digitally uploaded picture.</p>
<p>Some people prefer a <em>hardcover</em> to <em>paperback</em> for durability. Unfortunately, a <em>hardcover</em> publication is not possible with Amazon KDP. After searching on the web and reading various articles about other sites, which permit self-publication of hardcover books, I decided to try Lulu.com, even if I was a bit scared by <a href="https://artplusmarketing.com/scam-alert-stay-away-from-lulu-how-to-self-publish-a-book-part-5-adfb05580951">this very negative review</a>. The other options I looked at were either not appropriate for a math book, more complex to setup, or more expensive.</p>
<p>In the end, the process on Lulu.com is nearly as simple as the one of Amazon KDP. But for a hardback book, only one size is allowed: 6x9 inches. While the size is ok, I had to reformat the whole book to adapt to this size. Previously, with Amazon KDP, I had chosen a size of 7x10 inches, as it matched the freely available <a href="https://evoq-eval.siam.org/Publications/Books/About-SIAM-Books/For-Authors/Detail/Preparing-your-manuscript">LaTeX template for SIAM books</a>, which I like. Unfortunately, this template is not easy to update to a 6x9 inches size. Fortunately, I stumbled upon the <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/math/TeX/macrodoc.html">Princeton University LaTeX book template</a>, which covers various print sizes and looks good as well with the Garamond font. I was a bit surprised that the change in size increased the number of pages somewhat significantly. The choice of font (Garamond) and of smaller margins allowed to mitigate this issue.</p>
<p>Another consequence of the change of book template, was the discovery of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-title">half-title page</a>. I had never noticed before that books have often, not one, but two title pages. The reason for it is relatively obscure. For example, it could be <a href="https://blog.bookstellyouwhy.com/history-of-the-bastard-title">cut and used for labelling</a> purpose. <a href="https://www.renanatype.com/single-post/2017/02/15/What-is-the-Half-Title-Page">This page</a> explains a few more reasons.</p>
<p>To obtain a good looking cover was a bit more challenging with Lulu: they process the uploaded PNG or PDF image in strange ways with regards to the colors. A simple fix is to decrease the number of colors of the palette (I think I downgraded to 64 colors) in your favorite photo editor (<a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> in my case), before uploading the picture to Lulu.com. As with Amazon KDP, it is possible to download a template for the cover, which I found very useful, as it shows exactly the cuts and is of the proper dimension.</p>
<p>Amazon KDP also allows to sell the books in Kindle format. For Amazon e-readers, the outcome is unsatisfactory: the equations, the tables, the figures don&rsquo;t render properly. But for Amazon tablets, the PDF book can be converted to a Kindle format via <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1002998671">Amazon Kindle Textbook Creator</a> application and the outcome looks just like scaled PDF.</p>
<p>Overall, here is a table summarizing the advantages and drawbacks of each site:</p>

<p>For this book, the printing cost in around 7 euros on Amazon and 18 euros on Lulu. Lulu also involves higher shipping costs.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update 2021</strong></em>
If you ever publish on Lulu, do not choose the cream paper, it is way too dark and contrast in much better on the white paper. The white of Lulu is darker than the white of Amazon.</p>
<p>The biggest drawback of Lulu for this book is clearly the format. I find 7x10 inches much more appropriate for scientific books. Since the third edition, I publish the hardback in 6x9 inches on Lulu and the paperback in 7x10 inches on Amazon. I just use a simple scaling rule in Latex to produce the 7x10 inches version, which actually improves readability as the fonts and plots are scaled up.</p>
