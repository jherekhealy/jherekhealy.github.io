<p>In this third edition, the physical exercise feature is briefly discussed in the first two chapters. The section on how to imply the Black-Scholes volatility has been updated, with the improvements discussed <a href="https://quantsrus.github.io/post/implied_volatility_algorithms_go_julia/">in my blog</a>.
More details around the projected successive over-relaxation method for the pricing of American options have been added, as well as the relatively recent policy iteration method, particularly relevant in the case of negative interest rates, in Chapter 3. A more significant update is the presentation of the Andersen-Lake algorithm instead of the Ju-Zhong formula as fast pricing routine for the case of vanilla American options under the Black-Scholes model with constant parameters.
Chapter 4 has been updated around random number generation, antithetic variates, and the vectorization of the Monte-Carlo simulation.
Important corrections have been made around the pricing of forward starting options with finite difference methods in Chapter 8, as well as to the pricing of knock-in options.</p>
<p>Additional changes include paragraphs on the radial basis function interpolation of implied volatilities, the Cos and the Andersen-Lake methods for European options under stochastic volatility models, the Vega in stochastic volatility models, the interpolation of prices on the finite difference grid.</p>
<p>Example code for a set of important algorithms detailed in this book are available on the github Julia code repository <a href="https://github.com/jherekhealy/AQFED.jl">AQFED.jl</a>. More will appear progressively, along with a more precise documentation.</p>
