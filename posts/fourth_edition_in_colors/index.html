    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>The fourth edition of the book is now available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM9TL63J">Amazon</a> (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CM9TL63J">UK</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0CM9TL63J">DE</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CM9TL63J">FR</a>) as hardcover, printed in <strong><em>colors</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Some chapters have been split and their order has been updated. In terms of content, vanilla option pricing under the spot piecewise-lognormal model has been reworked and now includes newer approximations. The pricing of American options under negative rates adds the latest developments of Andersen and Lake. The sections on the finite difference method have been significantly updated, especially around grid stretching, payoff smoothing, the solution of the linear complementary problem under negative rates, and explicit <strong><em>super-time-stepping</em></strong> schemes. A variety of <strong><em>arbitrage-free</em></strong> representations for implied volatilities has been added, as well as an in-depth comparison of the various techniques on a set of concrete market data. Finally the chapter on stochastic volatility now includes simulation and calibration of <strong><em>rough volatility</em></strong> models.
More minor changes include the addition of the SABR approximation for basket option prices along with new details on the Black-Scholes approximations, a more careful summation for Monte-Carlo, the Jacobian based Vega for stochastic volatility models, fixing typos around the pricing of variance swaps, which also now presents more challenging examples.</p>
<p>Example code for a set of important algorithms detailed in this book are available on the github Julia code repository <a href="https://github.com/jherekhealy/AQFED.jl">AQFED.jl</a>. More will appear progressively, along with a more precise documentation.</p>
