    </header>
    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>This site is dedicated to my book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM9TL63J">Applied Quantitative Finance for Equity Derivatives</a> sold on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM9TL63J">Amazon</a> (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CM9TL63J">UK</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0CM9TL63J">DE</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CM9TL63J">FR</a>) as hardcover in colors. The book presents the most significant equity derivatives models used these days.
It is not a book around esoteric or cutting-edge models, but rather a book on relatively simple and standard models, viewed from the angle of a practitioner. A lot of
books present models in an abstract manner, often disconnected from how to apply
those in the real world. This book is different and explains all the details needed for an implementation of the models, at the cost of being relatively succint on the mathematical origins of the various models considered.</p>
<p>Even though it tries to stay basic, many of the subjects presented in this book have not been published in this kind of detail in the quantitative finance litterature so far. Let me list a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The book explains the issues raised by discrete <strong><em>cash dividends</em></strong> on the option price and study recent analytical approximations. Regarding American vanilla options, fast and stable finite difference schemes are analyzed, along with the inclusion of cash or proportional dividends, paying a particular attention to the effect of the dividend model on the exercise boundary.</li>
<li>In the description of the Monte-Carlo method, the <strong><em>parallelization</em></strong> of random numbers generation, the
<strong><em>randomization</em></strong> of quasi-random numbers, the various ways of generating of correlated
normal variates, the use of control variates and their caveats, as well as adjoint algorithmic differentiation techniques to compute sensitivities are detailed.</li>
<li>When it comes to using regressions, the typical example being the American Monte-Carlo technique of Longstaff and Schwartz, most books or papers present the classic polynomial regression. The book goes beyond and presents <strong><em>non-parametric regressions</em></strong>, such as non-conform regressions. Those are also studied later in the context of <strong><em>stochastic local volatility</em></strong> simulation by the particle method. In relation with the particle method, the book gives a vectorized algorithm for the Brownian-bridge variance reduction technique.</li>
<li>It shows the various issues that arise with the <strong><em>local volatility</em></strong> model in practice, and explains how to handle discrete cash dividends in the Dupire framework.</li>
<li>It gives an overview of volatility models calibration through various <strong><em>global minimizers</em></strong> or more clever local minimizations, along with detailed pricing techniques for each model considered.</li>
<li>It presents common exotics and how to evaluate those in a <strong><em>forward</em></strong> Monte-Carlo manner or in a <strong><em>backward</em></strong> PDE manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the second edition, various typos have been corrected, and the text has been slightly updated. New arbitrage-free implied volatility interpolations were added to chapter five, and different types of warrants, including callable bull/bear contracts (CBBCs) are  covered in chapter eight. The book layout has also been significantly updated to allow for a hardback book publication.</p>
<p>In the third edition, the physical exercise feature is briefly discussed in the first two chapters. The section on how to imply the Black-Scholes volatility has been updated, with the improvements discussed <a href="https://quantsrus.github.io/post/implied_volatility_algorithms_go_julia/">in my blog</a>.
More details around the projected successive over-relaxation method for the pricing of <strong><em>American options</em></strong> have been added, as well as the relatively recent policy iteration method, particularly relevant in the case of <strong><em>negative interest rates</em></strong>, in Chapter 3. A more significant update is the presentation of the Andersen-Lake algorithm instead of the Ju-Zhong formula as fast pricing routine for the case of vanilla American options under the Black-Scholes model with constant parameters.
Chapter 4 has been updated around random number generation, antithetic variates, and the <strong><em>vectorization</em></strong> of the Monte-Carlo simulation.
Important corrections have been made around the pricing of forward starting options with finite difference methods in Chapter 8, as well as to the pricing of knock-in options.
Additional changes include paragraphs on the radial basis function interpolation of implied volatilities, the Cos and the Andersen-Lake methods for European options under stochastic volatility models, the Vega in stochastic volatility models, the interpolation of prices on the finite difference grid.</p>
<p>The fourth edition is printed in colors. Some chapters have been split and their order has been updated. In terms of content, vanilla option pricing under the spot piecewise-lognormal model has been reworked and now includes newer approximations. The pricing of American options under negative rates adds the latest developments of Andersen and Lake. The sections on the finite difference method have been significantly updated, especially around grid stretching, payoff smoothing, the solution of the linear complementary problem under negative rates, and explicit <strong><em>super-time-stepping</em></strong> schemes. A variety of <strong><em>arbitrage-free</em></strong> representations for implied volatilities has been added, as well as an in-depth comparison of the various techniques on a set of concrete market data. Finally the chapter on stochastic volatility now includes simulation and calibration of <strong><em>rough volatility</em></strong> models.
More minor changes include the addition of the SABR approximation for basket option prices along with new details on the Black-Scholes approximations, a more careful summation for Monte-Carlo, the Jacobian based Vega for stochastic volatility models, fixing typos around the pricing of variance swaps, which also now presents more challenging examples.</p>
<p>Example code for a set of important algorithms detailed in this book are available on the github Julia code repository <a href="https://github.com/jherekhealy/AQFED.jl">AQFED.jl</a>. More will appear progressively, along with a more precise documentation.</p>
<p>Even if you are not so interested in equity derivatives, the numerical techniques presented should be of interest. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to take a look at the <a href="/eqd_book_toc.pdf">table of contents</a>.</p><ul class="pa0">
