It is not a book around esoteric or cutting-edge models, but rather a book on relatively simple and standard models, viewed from the angle of a practitioner. A lot of
books present models in an abstract manner, often disconnected from how to apply
those in the real world. This book is different and explains all the details needed for an implementation of the models, at the cost of being relatively succint on the mathematical origins of the various models considered.</p>

<p>Even though it tries to stay basic, many of the subjects presented in this book have not been published in this kind of detail in the quantitative finance litterature so far. Let me list a few examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>The book explains the issues raised by discrete <strong><em>cash dividends</em></strong> on the option price and study recent analytical approximations. Regarding American vanilla options, fast and stable finite difference schemes are analyzed, along with the inclusion of cash or proportional dividends, paying a particular attention to the effect of the dividend model on the exercise boundary.</li>
<li>In the description of the Monte-Carlo method, the <strong><em>parallelization</em></strong> of random numbers generation, the
<strong><em>randomization</em></strong> of quasi-random numbers, the various ways of generating of correlated
normal variates, the use of control variates and their caveats, as well as adjoint algorithmic differentiation techniques to compute sensitivities are detailed.</li>
<li>When it comes to using regressions, the typical example being the American Monte-Carlo technique of Longstaff and Schwartz, most books or papers present the classic polynomial regression. The book goes beyond and presents <strong><em>non-parametric regressions</em></strong>, such as non-conform regressions. Those are also studied later in the context of <strong><em>stochastic local volatility</em></strong> simulation by the particle method. In relation with the particle method, the book gives a vectorized algorithm for the Brownian-bridge variance reduction technique.</li>
<li>It shows the various issues that arise with the <strong><em>local volatility</em></strong> model in practice, and explains how to handle discrete cash dividends in the Dupire framework.</li>
<li>It gives an overview of volatility models calibration through various <strong><em>global minimizers</em></strong> or more clever local minimizations, along with detailed pricing techniques for each model considered.</li>
<li>It presents common exotics and how to evaluate those in a <strong><em>forward</em></strong> Monte-Carlo manner or in a <strong><em>backward</em></strong> PDE manner.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if you are not so interested in equity derivatives, the numerical techniques presented should be of interest. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to take a look at the <a href="/eqd_book_toc.pdf">table of contents</a>.</p>
