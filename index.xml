      <description>As you will have probably already noticed, the front and back pictures of my book are fractals. But they are not just any fractal. They are generated by coloring the number of iterations needed to solve the implied volatility of a vanilla option of a given price in the complex plane, using a root finding algorithm like Newton&amp;rsquo;s method or Householder&amp;rsquo;s method. Each point corresponds to a complex implied volatility guess and the more iterations needed, the darker is the point.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This site is dedicated to my book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Quantitative-Finance-Equity-Derivatives/dp/1977557872/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1512726313&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=jherek+healy&#34;&gt;Applied Quantitative Finance for Equity Derivatives&lt;/a&gt; available on Amazon (&lt;a href=&#34;http://a.co/49Yfhiw&#34;&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.eu/b4IfZ2b&#34;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.eu/5VqLdXb&#34;&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/dp/1977557872/ref=cm_sw_em
_r_mt_dp_U_S9LkAbKGBGVQ3&#34;&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;). The book presents the most significant equity derivatives models used these days.
It is not a book around esoteric or cutting-edge models, but rather a book on relatively simple and standard models, viewed from the angle of a practitioner. A lot of
books present models in an abstract manner, often disconnected from how to apply
those in the real world. This book is different and explains all the details needed for an implementation of the models, at the cost of being relatively succint on the mathematical origins of the various models considered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
