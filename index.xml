      <description>The fourth edition of the book is now available on Amazon (UK, DE, FR) as hardcover, printed in colors.
Some chapters have been split and their order has been updated. In terms of content, vanilla option pricing under the spot piecewise-lognormal model has been reworked and now includes newer approximations. The pricing of American options under negative rates adds the latest developments of Andersen and Lake. The sections on the finite difference method have been significantly updated, especially around grid stretching, payoff smoothing, the solution of the linear complementary problem under negative rates, and explicit super-time-stepping schemes.</description>

      <description>A third edition of the book is now available on Amazon (UK, DE, FR) as paperback and Lulu as hardcover.
In this third edition, the physical exercise feature is briefly discussed in the first two chapters. The section on how to imply the Black-Scholes volatility has been updated, with the improvements discussed in my blog. More details around the projected successive over-relaxation method for the pricing of American options have been added, as well as the relatively recent policy iteration method, particularly relevant in the case of negative interest rates, in Chapter 3.</description>

      <title>Self-publishing, Amazon KDP vs Lulu.com</title>
      <link>https://jherekhealy.github.io/posts/self_publication_amazon_kdp_vs_lulu/</link>

      <description>Initially, I published my book through the simplest solution, Amazon CreateSpace, now known as Amazon KDP. The experience was overall great. Amazon KDP allows to print the book in the size of our choice. The standard paper quality is good and the cover looks very much like the digitally uploaded picture.
Some people prefer a hardcover to paperback for durability. Unfortunately, a hardcover publication is not possible with Amazon KDP. After searching on the web and reading various articles about other sites, which permit self-publication of hardcover books, I decided to try Lulu.</description>

      <title>About the cover: implied volatility fractals!</title>

      <description>As you will have probably already noticed, the front and back pictures of my book are fractals. But they are not just any fractal. They are generated by coloring the number of iterations needed to solve the implied volatility of a vanilla option of a given price in the complex plane, using a root finding algorithm like Newton&amp;rsquo;s method or Householder&amp;rsquo;s method. Each point corresponds to a complex implied volatility guess and the more iterations needed, the darker is the point.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This site is dedicated to my book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM9TL63J&#34;&gt;Applied Quantitative Finance for Equity Derivatives&lt;/a&gt; sold on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM9TL63J&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CM9TL63J&#34;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0CM9TL63J&#34;&gt;DE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0CM9TL63J&#34;&gt;FR&lt;/a&gt;) as hardcover in colors. The book presents the most significant equity derivatives models used these days.
It is not a book around esoteric or cutting-edge models, but rather a book on relatively simple and standard models, viewed from the angle of a practitioner. A lot of
books present models in an abstract manner, often disconnected from how to apply
those in the real world. This book is different and explains all the details needed for an implementation of the models, at the cost of being relatively succint on the mathematical origins of the various models considered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
